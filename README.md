# Challenge card game becode

## Description
A training project in which the goal is to set the minimum requirements for a card game to work. The game does not have to be playable. 

## Installation
Python has to be installed on the computer. Then, all you have to do is run  ```main.py``` to launch the script.

Command : ```python main.py```

## Usage
As there is no concrete game in there, there isn't anything to do. The program starts by instantiating a board, a list of players currently playing, a classic set of 52 cards with a symbol (spade, ...), and a value associated with it. Then, the cards are distributed evenly between the players. Each turn, the program selects and plays a random card from each player's hand until every player has used all his cards.
